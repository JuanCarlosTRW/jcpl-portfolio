  {
    question: "How fast do we see results?",
    answer:
      "Foundation clients go live in 2–3 weeks. Growth clients typically see first qualified leads within 30 days. Timeline depends on your market and readiness.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade my plan later?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You can upgrade at any time and we'll credit your existing investment toward the new tier. Most clients start with Growth and scale from there.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a contract or lock-in?",
    answer:
      "No long-term contracts. Engagements are milestone-based and transparent. You stay because it works, not because you're locked in.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do you need from me to get started?",
    answer:
      "Clear goals, timely feedback, and access to existing assets (if any). We handle the heavy lifting — you stay focused on running your business.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer discounts for annual billing?",
    answer:
      "Yes, annual commitments receive a 17% discount. This reflects our ability to plan longer-term and deliver compounding results.",
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer:
      "We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex) and bank transfers. Payments are processed securely via Stripe in CAD or USD.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if it's not a fit?",
    answer:
      "If we're not a fit, you'll get honest feedback and recommendations — no hard sell. We'd rather pass than deliver subpar work.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure success?",
    answer:
      "Pipeline metrics, conversion rates, and ROI — not vanity stats. Every engagement includes tracking from day one so results are verifiable.",
  },
];
